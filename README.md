# Internship-Work
This repository contains some of the work I did in the summer of 2024. The files are R files I used to create data visualizations for some business processes. 

- [ShearCyclesVisualization.R](https://github.com/pweave5/Internship-Work/blob/main/ShearCyclesVisualization.R)

  In this file, I am reading data from an excel file, cleaning and formating the data, and creating bar charts and line graphs   for different time frames of data using custom functions. Below are examples of the visualizations created.
