# Internship-Work
This repository contains some of the work I did as a data analyst intern in the summer of 2024. The files are R files I used to create data visualizations for some business processes. 

<ul>
<li><a href = "https://github.com/pweave5/Internship-Work/blob/main/ShearCyclesVisualization.R">ShearCyclesVisualization.R</a>

In this file I read in data from an excel file, clean and format the data, and create bar charts and line graphs using custom functions. Below are some examples of the visualizations I created.</li>
