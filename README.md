# Internship-Work
This repository contains some of the work I did as a data analyst intern in the summer of 2024. The files are R files I used to create data visualizations for some business processes. 

<ul>
<li><a href = "https://github.com/pweave5/Internship-Work/blob/main/ShearCyclesVisualization.R">ShearCyclesVisualization.R</a>

In this file I read in data from an excel file, cleaned and formated the data, and created bar charts and line graphs using custom functions. Below are some examples of the visualizations I created.</li> 
<ul>
  <li><a href = "https://github.com/pweave5/Internship-Work/blob/main/Sierra_Daily_Cycles.pdf">Monthly Production Bar Chart</a></li>
  <li><a href = "https://github.com/pweave5/Internship-Work/blob/main/Sierra_Hourly_Cycles.pdf">Hourly Production Bar Chart</a></li>
  <li><a href = "https://github.com/pweave5/Internship-Work/blob/main/Sierra_Cycles_Line_Chart.pdf">Monthly Production Line Chart</a></li>
</ul>

In this file, I read in data from an excel file, cleaned it, and created a bar chart of average values, while also overlaying individual data point. Below is an example of what was produced.
